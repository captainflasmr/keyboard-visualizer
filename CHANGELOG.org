A major refactor and some functional improvements

*Functionality Improvements:*
- Simplified and optimized keyside determination with `keyboard-visualizer--key-sides`.

*User Interaction:*
- Enhanced `keyboard-visualizer-menu` with clearer navigation:
  - Toggle ergonomic indicators, documentation display, and visualizer mode.
  - Explore commands via fuzzy search (`keyboard-visualizer-learn-command-by-query`) or random steps (`keyboard-visualizer-learning-step`).
  - Save the current layout with a dedicated option.
- Added `keyboard-visualizer-documentation-toggle` to enable/disable displaying command documentation.

*Refactoring:*
- Consolidated and streamlined redundant functions for simplicity and readability.
- Improved buffer management for visualizer output:
  - Handles layout buffer cleanup when disabling.
  - Ensures exclusive usage of the visualizer buffer.

*Keybindings:*
- Updated keybindings:
  - `C-c b` for opening `keyboard-visualizer-menu`.

Added ergonomic indicator

- Enhanced `keyboard-visualizer--draw-single-layout` to optionally highlight non-ergonomic key combinations based on chord-side alignment.
- Added `keyboard-visualizer--key-side` helper function to determine if a key belongs to the left or right side of the keyboard layout.
- Implemented `keyboard-visualizer-ergonomic-indicator-toggle` to allow toggling ergonomic highlighting via user interaction.
- Added a new customizable variable `keyboard-visualizer-ergonomic-indicator` to manage the state of the ergonomic indicator.
- Updated the interactive command menu to include the ergonomic indicator toggle `[e]`.

** <2025-01-24>

Enhanced with natural language query commands and new features

- Added a `keyboard-visualizer-query-command-map` to map natural language queries to Emacs commands.
  - Examples: "open file" → `find-file`, "undo" → `undo`, "search" → `isearch-forward`, etc.
- Implemented a new command `keyboard-visualizer-learn-command-by-query`:
  - Allows users to search for commands via fuzzy queries and visualize their keybindings.
- Added `keyboard-visualizer-save-layout`:
  - Saves the current keyboard layout buffer to a file and opens it in a buffer.
- Modified key bindings in the shell menu:
  - Added `[j]` for searching commands via natural language queries.
  - Added `[s]` for saving the keyboard layout.
  - Removed `[l]` and deprecated learning mode toggle.

Enhance keyboard visualizer with learning mode and user interface improvements

- Added a new `keyboard-visualizer-learning-mode` to help users learn keybindings via random command prompts.
- Introduced new commands: 
  - `keyboard-visualizer-learning-step` for manual stepping through commands.
  - `keyboard-visualizer-learning-mode-toggle` to enable/disable learning mode.
  - `keyvis-menu` to provide an interactive menu for visualizer-related actions.
- Updated the keyboard layout to reflect more accurate key representations (e.g., renamed "RET" and "SPC").
- Improved documentation display within the keyboard visualizer buffer.
- Enhanced UI:
  - Used bold styling for section headers (e.g., "Description:").
  - Adjusted layout buffer display settings for better usability.
- Added customization options:
  - `keyboard-visualizer-learning-exclude-commands` to exclude certain commands from learning mode.
  - `keyboard-visualizer-monospace-face` face includes adjustable height.
- Various refactoring and bug fixes, such as filtering unnecessary characters from key descriptions.
