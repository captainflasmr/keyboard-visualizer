Enhance keyboard visualizer with learning mode and user interface improvements

- Added a new `keyboard-visualizer-learning-mode` to help users learn keybindings via random command prompts.
- Introduced new commands: 
  - `keyboard-visualizer-learning-step` for manual stepping through commands.
  - `keyboard-visualizer-learning-mode-toggle` to enable/disable learning mode.
  - `keyvis-menu` to provide an interactive menu for visualizer-related actions.
- Updated the keyboard layout to reflect more accurate key representations (e.g., renamed "RET" and "SPC").
- Improved documentation display within the keyboard visualizer buffer.
- Enhanced UI:
  - Used bold styling for section headers (e.g., "Description:").
  - Adjusted layout buffer display settings for better usability.
- Added customization options:
  - `keyboard-visualizer-learning-exclude-commands` to exclude certain commands from learning mode.
  - `keyboard-visualizer-monospace-face` face includes adjustable height.
- Various refactoring and bug fixes, such as filtering unnecessary characters from key descriptions.
